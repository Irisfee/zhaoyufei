I am a PhD candidate in cognitive neuroscience at University of Oregon. I apply machine learning techniques to analyze brain imaging data to investigate human episodic memory mechanism and predict memory behavior. Along my doctoral training, I find my enthusiasm in solving problems using both structured and unstructured data, inferring from both classic and state-of-art algorithms, and communicating stories and insights derived from the data in business settings. 

Detail information about my projects can be found [here]({{< relref "/project_landing" >}}).
