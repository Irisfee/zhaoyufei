Given the vast number of memories that humans store, overlap between memories is inevitable. For example, two students in your new class might look very similar to each other, and you find it hard to distinguish them. Similarity between memories is a primary cause of interference and forgetting. However, with adequate learning, our brain can successfully tackle with memory interference finally. What is the mechanism behind this process?

In this study, by using fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) technique, we tried to answer how does our brain resolve memory interference caused by similarity. We show that when remembering highly similar objects, subtle differences in the features of these objects are exaggerated in memory in order to reduce interference. These memory distortions are reflected in, and predicted by, overlap of activity patterns in lateral parietal cortex. These findings provide unique insight into how memory interference is resolved and specifically implicate lateral parietal cortex in representing feature-specific memory distortions.
