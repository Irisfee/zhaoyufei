I am a PhD candidate in cognitive neuroscience at University of Oregon. Throughout my doctoral training, I designed controlled experiments, analyzed brain imaging data, and combined machine learning techniques and statistical inference to study the neural mechanism of human memory. During this process, I worked on many large data sets, and have sharpen my skills on feature engineering, visualization, and different modeling techniques. Meanwhile, I went through a Data Science Specialization track to get a better understanding on the math and stats behind these classic algorithms. I'm also learning more state-of-the-art algorithms and trying to apply them to my side projects in my spare time. 

Detail information about my projects can be found [here]({{< relref "/project_landing" >}}).
